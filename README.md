Please check out [Running Symfony on App Engine for PHP 7.2][symfony-appengine-php72] instead.

## [Symfony][symfony] for [Google App Engine][appengine]
This repository contains a Symfony app for Google App Engine, based off the Symfony Standard Edition.

See [How to Run Symfony Hello World on App Engine Standard Environment][symfony_community]
for the full tutorial.

## Installation

Install this via [composer][composer]. Follow the
[installation instructions][composer_install] if you do not already have
composer installed.

Once composer is installed, execute the following command to create this project:

```sh
composer create-project google/appengine-symfony-starter-project
```

## Set Up

To run the starter app, be sure to authorize gcloud for your project.

```
gcloud auth login
```

## Run Locally

```sh
composer run-script server --timeout=0
```

Now browse to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to view your running
application. This builds the cache for the "dev" environment and runs the
`dev_appserver.py` script, which will be available if you've installed the
[Google App Engine Launcher][app_engine_launcher]. The command for this is
defined in `scripts/deploy.php`.

## Deployment

Deploy to your App Engine instance by running the following command:

```sh
composer run-script deploy --timeout=0
```

This builds the cache for the "prod" environment and runs `gcloud app deploy`,
which will be available if you've installed the
[Google Cloud SDK][gcloud]. The command for this is defined in
`scripts/deploy.php`.

## Using Twig

It should be noted this example application uses a subclass of `Twig_Environment`,
defined in `src/Twig/Environment.php` and configured in `app/config/services.yml`.
The reason for this subclass is to customize the `getOptionsHash` method. Without
this, the cache cannot be warmed up outside of the PHP version being used in App
Engine.

## Troubleshooting

1. If Composer fails to download the dependencies, make sure that your local PHP installation
satisfies Composer's [system requirements][composer_reqs]. Specifically, [cURL][curl] support is
required.

1. If you see errors about missing the default Cloud Storage bucket, follow the
[cloud integration instructions][gcs_setup] to create a default bucket for your project.
